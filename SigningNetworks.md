# Signing Networks

This is a predictiopn that a new form of business model in a hyper bitcoinised world, will be the proision of "signed proofs" of what has happened in the world.

These will effectively be managed networks in which a set of facts are committed to with a particular know public key. 

These allow automation of contracts, built on the idea that individuals can assess a validate a signers past performance and choose appropriately if these networks will be appropaite to enforce specific contracts / behaviour.
