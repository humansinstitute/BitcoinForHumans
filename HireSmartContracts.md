# Smart Contracts Will be Hired

One different between Ethereum and Bitcoin is in the approach to money and value.  

I'm going to provide two heavily paraphrased quotes to differentiate this: 

Bitcoin value prop:

> "Value is driven by scarcity and a credible monetary policy that enforces scarcity"

Ethereum value prop:

> "Ethereum will be valuable as we build Dapps/Defi as this will drive utility and therefore value into the underlying asset used to pay for this utility which is ETH"

The key diference here is that in the bitcon world view the asset is valuable due to internal properties, in the Ethereum world view the asset is valuable based on external factors. 

I believe this has a direct use on long term value of each of these assets (and in reality any asset which seeks to build value through utility).  The point being that if your asset relies on extrinsic value generation, then there is nothing to stop everything valuable being ported to a new network over a long enough time frame. 

Yes Network effects are a thing, but networks do change over time:

* Telegram > Phone > VoIP
* Post > Email > Social Apps

I don't hold the belief that a smart contract are not useufl. Hell Lightning is excellent and there are certainly ways to mitigate trust through other structured contract arrangements, however, it would be strange to assume that the contract platform is the value. 

> The $ or the asset holds the value in a traditional contract, not the paper.

It is my belief that long term Smart Contracts will merely be "hired when required"
