# Lockbox Transaction Construction

#### An offchain construction for bitcoin contract enforcement

***Note*** This is provided as an unfinished high level concept.

The purpose of the lockbox contract contrsuction is to provide a set of pre-signed bitcoin transactions which can be reliably enforced in line with real world use cases.

It is assume this would be deployed over a channel factory construction in order to allow sufficient flexibility.  More information on [channel factory construction is availabe in the whitepaper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124062/).

Example use cases would include:

- Prediction / betting markets hosted on lightning.

- Exchange of goods.

- "Smart contracting"
