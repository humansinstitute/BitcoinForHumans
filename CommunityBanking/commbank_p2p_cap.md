# Community Banking - P2P Capital Markets
### or 
## Real Yield > Potemkin Yield

There has recently been an awful lot of "rah rah" around the concept of volcano and bitcoin bonds.

Whilst I like the iea of freedom from the IMF, centrally planned and issued investments have never felt like the most "bitcoin" way to open up the country to the transformative power of international finance. 

Perhaps, it would be better to return to what worked well, bottom up community driven solutions.

The purpose of this concept is to explore, in an open source environment, a design for the delivery of international investment markets powered by bitcoin. 

To understand how people can use bitcoin to invest in captial formation where it is most required without the requirement for a single centrally planned state actor to dictate the terms and disbursements of funds.

Instead this design will make use of a network of private / community banks who can manage and mitigate credit risks and make this market.

This will allow the global bitcoin industry to "put bitcoin to work" in order to create productive enterprises and drive real yield. 

In many ways you could consider this the "real defi", decentralized peer to peer financing in order to drive real yields, from real businesses.

This design revolves around three actors. 

1. The business owner
2. The community bank
3. the Investor

#### The Business Owner

#### The Community Bank

#### The Investor
