# Bitcoin For Humans

Collection of high level concept designs/ideas, thoughts and articles.  

This is all a work in progress and the idea is to begin building out a bit of an opensource knowledge base.  Ideally the community will be able to draw on these ideas and musings to build new products or educational material indstead of these just sitting in my head!
