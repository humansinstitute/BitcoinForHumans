# Stable Bond Wallet

This is an application sitting on top of and integrating with lightning and bitcoin nodes, ideally this could be added to existing wallets and application stacks (for example Sphinx.Chat) in order leverage existing identity, group and messaging infrastructure.

The client will require functionality to manage several scenarios.

* Automated discovery and order matching: how does Larry meet sally.   
* Reputation: Sally wants to take a market offer from Larry and is assessing his reputauion as a peer. 
* DLC Management: Negotiation, signing and enforcement of DLC.
* Exposure calculations, 
* Automated rolling of bond contracts. 

For the purposes of this design I will exapnd on these functionalities as though I was designing this applicaiton on top of the Sphinx.Chat appliction stack.
